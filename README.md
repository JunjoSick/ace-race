# Ace Race - The Card-iest Race in Town! 🏁🃏

Welcome to **Ace Race**, the only game where four aces compete in a high-stakes sprint to the finish line, fueled by luck, strategy, and a deck of cards with a mind of its own! Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game is ready to race right out of the box on GitHub Pages.

## What’s This Madness About? 🤔

In **Ace Race**, the four aces (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades) are tired of being the "top dogs" in boring card games. They've decided to lace up their tiny card-shoes and race to glory! Your job? Draw cards from a 52-card deck (minus the aces, because they're too busy racing) and watch the drama unfold:

- **Draw a card**: The ace matching the suit of the drawn card zooms forward one level.
- **Hit a checkpoint**: When all aces reach a level, a sneaky obstacle card flips over, sending one unlucky ace backward.
- **Win the race**: The first ace to cross the finish line at level 5 claims victory (and probably brags about it forever).

It’s a game of chance, chaos, and card-based comedy. Will Hearts break hearts with a last-second win? Will Spades dig their way to the top? Only the deck knows!

## How to Play (Because Aces Don’t Wait!) 🎮

1. Click the **Draw Pile** to pull a card and see which ace gets a boost.
2. Watch as the aces climb the track, dodging obstacles like drama queens.
3. Cheer (or cry) when an ace hits the finish line or gets sent back by a pesky obstacle card.
4. Hit **New Game** to reset the chaos and race again!
